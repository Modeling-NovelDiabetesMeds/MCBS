## Summary
Using Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) data, we assessed the association between out-of-pocket expenditures and adherence for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) among Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes at various income levels. 

 We analyzed combined data from five longitudinally weighted two-year panels of beneficiaries with self-reported or claims-based diagnoses of diabetes and use of GLP-1 RAs (n = 2,187,500) and SLGT2is (n= 1,741,910 ) in year 1 from the 2016-2021 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. Out-of-pocket drug expenses and proportion days covered (PDC) by prescriptions were calculated for Year 1 (baseline) and Year 2 (follow-up). We created two separate cohorts for GLP-1RA and SGLT2i users, including individuals who use both drugs in each cohort. We analyzed these cohorts independently and subdivided them by baseline income below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level  We used generalized Poisson regression to assess the association of Beneficiaries out-pocket-costs for target drugs classes and income with adherence, adjusting for patient characteristics and other diabetes medication use.
