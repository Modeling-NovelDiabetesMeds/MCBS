Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) prescription adherence analysis

We assessed the association between out-of-pocket spending and uptake of prescription fills across different income levels among Medicare enrollees receiving glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). 

 We analyzed combined data from five longitudinally weighted two-year panels of beneficiaries with self-reported or claims-based diagnoses of diabetes and use of GLP-1 RAs (n = ) and SLGT2is (n= ) in year 1 from the 2016-2021 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. Out-of-pocket drug expenses and medication days covered were calculated for Year 1 (baseline) and Year 2 (follow-up). Other baseline variables?  We used Poisson regression to assess the association of Beneficiaries out-pocket-costs for target drugs classes and income with adherence adjusting for patient characteristics and other diabetes medication use.
